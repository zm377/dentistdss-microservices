## Running the Application

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (for Docker deployment)
- JDK 21 (for local development)
- Maven (or use the included Maven wrapper)

### Local Development (Without Docker)

For local development where you want to run services directly on your machine:

#### Starting Services Locally

To start all services locally using Java JAR files:

```bash
chmod +x start-local.sh
./start-local.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build all microservices using Maven
2. Start each service in the correct order using `java -jar target/*.jar`
3. Run services in the background with logs written to the `logs/` directory
4. Wait 10 seconds between each service startup for stability

The startup order is:
1. Config Server
2. Discovery Server (Eureka)
3. API Gateway
4. Auth Service (with integrated OAuth2)
5. Audit Service
6. System Service
7. GenAI Service
8. Clinic Service
9. Patient Service
10. Admin Server
11. Notification Service

#### Stopping Local Services

To stop all locally running services:

```bash
chmod +x stop-local.sh
./stop-local.sh
```

This will find and stop all Java processes started by the `run-local.sh` script.

#### Local Development Notes

- Each service's logs are stored in the `logs/` directory (e.g., `logs/config-server.log`)
- Services run on their default ports (see Service Endpoints section)
- You'll need to start PostgreSQL and MongoDB separately (either via Docker or local installation)
- For databases, you can use: `docker-compose up -d postgres mongo`

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment using Docker:

#### Starting Docker Services

To start all services using Docker containers:

```bash
chmod +x start-docker.sh
./start-docker.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build all microservices using Maven
2. Check if PostgreSQL/MongoDB containers are already running
   - If running, preserves database containers to maintain data
   - If not running, starts everything from scratch
3. Start all services in Docker containers in the correct order
4. Show logs from all services

#### Stopping Docker Services

To stop all Docker services except databases:

```bash
chmod +x stop-docker.sh
./stop-docker.sh
```

This will preserve the PostgreSQL and MongoDB containers to keep your data intact.

If you need to stop databases as well:

```bash
docker-compose stop postgres mongo
```

To completely bring down all containers including volumes:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

### Checking Service Status

To check the status of all services, run:

```bash
chmod +x service-status.sh
./service-status.sh
```

This will show which Docker services are running and display their exposed ports.

**Note**: This script currently only checks Docker container status. For local services, use `ps aux | grep java` to see running Java processes.

## Available Scripts

```

### Testing API Gateway Security

To test the centralized JWT authentication system:

```bash
# Test the security implementation
chmod +x test-gateway-security.sh
./test-gateway-security.sh
```

This script tests:
- ‚úÖ Public endpoints (should return 200)
- ‚úÖ Protected endpoints without token (should return 401)
- ‚úÖ Protected endpoints with invalid token (should return 401)
- ‚úÖ API Gateway health check (should return 200)

**Manual Testing Examples:**

## üîí Security Architecture

### Centralized JWT Authentication

The system implements a **centralized security architecture** where the API Gateway serves as the single point of authentication and authorization:

#### Security Flow
```
Client Request ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí JWT Validation ‚Üí Role Check ‚Üí Forward with Headers ‚Üí Business Service
```

#### Component Responsibilities

**üö™ API Gateway (Security Hub)**
- Validates JWT token signature using JWKS from auth-service
- Extracts user context (ID, email, roles, clinic ID) from JWT payload
- Enforces role-based access control per endpoint
- Applies clinic-based filtering for CLINIC_ADMIN users
- Forwards authenticated requests with user context headers
- Rejects unauthorized requests with proper HTTP status codes (401/403)

**üîê Auth Service (Token Issuer)**
- Issues signed JWT tokens containing user information
- Provides JWKS endpoint for token validation
- Manages user authentication (login/signup)
- Handles user management and role assignment
- **Does not validate tokens** (delegated to API Gateway)

**üè• Business Services (Header-Based Auth)**
- Extract user context from HTTP headers forwarded by API Gateway
- Use `UserContextUtil` classes for user information access
- Focus purely on business logic without security concerns
- **No JWT token handling or security configuration**

#### Role-Based Access Control

| Role | Access Level | Clinic Filtering | Example Endpoints |
|------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `SYSTEM_ADMIN` | All endpoints | No filtering | All APIs |
| `CLINIC_ADMIN` | Clinic-specific | Own clinic only | `/api/clinic/{id}/patients` |
| `RECEPTIONIST` | Clinic-specific | Own clinic only | `/api/clinic/{id}/patients` |
| `DENTIST` | Clinical data | Clinic-based | `/api/patient/*` |
| `PATIENT` | Own records | Own data only | `/api/patient/profile` |

#### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration
- `GET /api/auth/oauth2/jwks` - JWT validation keys

**OAuth2 Authentication:**
- `POST /oauth2/token` - Google ID token verification (popup flow)
- `GET /oauth2/authorization/google` - OAuth2 authorization initiation
- `GET /login/oauth2/code/google` - OAuth2 callback (redirect flow)

**Clinic Information:**
- `GET /api/clinic/list/all` - Public clinic listing
- `GET /api/clinic/search` - Public clinic search
- `POST /api/clinic` - Clinic registration

**AI Chatbots:**
- `POST /api/genai/chatbot/help` - General help chatbot
- `POST /api/genai/chatbot/triage` - Medical triage assistance
- `POST /api/genai/chatbot/receptionist` - Appointment scheduling
- `POST /api/genai/chatbot/aidentist` - AI dentist consultation

**System:**
- `GET /actuator/health` - Health checks
- `GET /v3/api-docs` - OpenAPI documentation (development only)

#### User Context Headers

The API Gateway forwards user information to downstream services via HTTP headers:

```http
X-User-ID: 12345
X-User-Email: user@example.com
X-User-Roles: CLINIC_ADMIN,DENTIST
X-Clinic-ID: 67890
```

#### TLS/SSL Security

- API Gateway configured with TLS/SSL certificates for secure HTTPS communication
- All internal service communication happens within a secure Docker network
- Production deployment uses HTTPS on port 443

- **[REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md](REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md)** - Summary of the refactoring process and benefits achieved

### üîß Development Guide for Security

#### Adding New Protected Endpoints

1. **Define authorization rules** in `api-gateway/src/main/java/.../JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`
2. **Extract user context** in your service controller using `UserContextUtil`

```java
@RestController
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/my-endpoint")
    public ResponseEntity<?> myEndpoint(HttpServletRequest request) {
        String userId = UserContextUtil.getUserId(request);
        List<String> roles = UserContextUtil.getUserRoles(request);
        Long clinicId = UserContextUtil.getClinicIdAsLong(request);

        // Your business logic here
    }
}
```

#### Adding Public Endpoints

Add the endpoint pattern to `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS` in `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`:

```java
private static final Set<String> PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS = Set.of(
    "/api/auth/",
    "/api/clinic/list/all",
    "/api/your-new-public-endpoint"  // Add here
);
```

## Development

### Local Development

For local development, you can run services individually or all at once:

#### Running Individual Services Locally

To run a single service locally for development:

```bash
cd <service-name>
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

For example, to run only the auth-service:

```bash
cd auth-service
../mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Running All Services Locally

Use the provided script to run all services:

```bash
./start-local.sh
```

This is useful for testing the complete microservices ecosystem locally.

### Docker Development

For Docker-based development:

#### Running Individual Services in Docker

To rebuild and restart a specific service without affecting others:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d <service-name>
```

For example, to rebuild only the auth-service:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d auth-service
```

#### Running All Services in Docker

Use the provided script:

```bash
./start-docker.sh
```

### Development Tips

- **Local Development**: Faster restart times, easier debugging with IDEs, direct access to application logs
- **Docker Development**: Consistent environment, easier database setup, closer to production environment
- **Hybrid Approach**: Run databases in Docker (`docker-compose up -d postgres mongo`) and services locally
- **Logs**: Local development logs are in `logs/` directory, Docker logs via `docker-compose logs -f`
- **Ports**: All services use the same ports in both local and Docker modes (see Service Endpoints section)
- **OAuth2 Configuration**: Auth-service now requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables for OAuth2 functionality

#### Security Development Notes

- **API Gateway**: Only service that handles JWT tokens and security
- **Business Services**: Use `UserContextUtil` to extract user information from headers
- **Testing**: Use `./test-gateway-security.sh` to verify security implementation
- **Debugging**: Check API Gateway logs for authentication/authorization issues
- **New Endpoints**: Add authorization rules in `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`
- **Public Endpoints**: Configure in `PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS` set for no-auth access

## Building & Publishing Production Images

The repository provides an automated script to build and publish multi-service Docker images targeting **linux/amd64**. Each image is tagged by service name and an optional version:

```bash
# Build and push images using the default tag "latest"
./build-and-push.sh

# Build and push images using a custom version tag
./build-and-push.sh v1.2.3
```

Images are published to Docker Hub under
`zm377/dentistdss-microservices:<service>-<tag>`.

## Deploying on a Production Host

On the target server (already provisioned with Docker and Docker Compose) run:

```bash
# Pull and deploy the latest images
./deploy.sh

# Or deploy a specific version
./deploy.sh v1.2.3
```

The script will:

1. Pull the latest images for each microservice from Docker Hub.
2. Retag them for use by `docker-compose`.
3. Stop and remove existing service containers (excluding the **postgres** container so your data is preserved).
4. Start the fresh containers in detached mode.

> Note: The PostgreSQL database runs in its own persistent container and volume; deployments never rebuild or replace it automatically.

## üîÑ Recent Architecture Improvements

### GenAI Service Configuration (application.yml)
```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      chat:
        options:
          model: gpt-4o-mini
    vertex:
      ai:
        gemini:
          project-id: ${VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID:}
          location: ${VERTEX_AI_LOCATION:us-central1}
          chat:
            options:
              model: gemini-1.5-flash

genai:
  providers:
    default-provider: openai
    switching:
      enable-failover: true
      max-retries: 3
      timeout-ms: 30000
      enable-load-balancing: false
      load-balancing-strategy: round_robin
    openai:
      enabled: true

## üìã Usage Examples

### Anonymous User Flow
```bash
# 1. Anonymous user makes first request (no ANON_ID header)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/genai/chatbot/help \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"What are your clinic hours?"'

# API Gateway automatically:
# - Generates secure anonymous session ID
# - Propagates headers: X-Session-ID, empty X-User-ID, X-User-Email, X-User-Roles, X-Clinic-ID
# - GenAI service receives context and provides anonymous-friendly response
```

### User Authentication with Session Linking
```bash
# 2. User authenticates (preserving anonymous session)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "ANON_ID: <anonymous_session_id_from_step_1>" \
  -d '{
    "email": "patient@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# API Gateway:
# - Links anonymous session to authenticated user
# - Continues sending same X-Session-ID
# - Now includes X-User-ID, X-User-Email, X-User-Roles, X-Clinic-ID
```

### Role-Based Prompt Customization
```bash
# Patient request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/genai/chatbot/help \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <patient_jwt_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"What is a root canal?"'

# Response uses patient-friendly language:
# "A root canal is a treatment to repair and save a badly damaged or infected tooth..."

# Dentist request (same question)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/genai/chatbot/help \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <dentist_jwt_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"What is a root canal?"'

# Response uses technical terminology:
# "Endodontic therapy involves removal of infected pulp tissue from the root canal system..."
```

### Provider Switching Configuration
```bash
# Configure failover in application.yml
genai:
  providers:
    default-provider: openai
    switching:
      enable-failover: true
      max-retries: 3
      timeout-ms: 30000

# Make request - if OpenAI fails, automatically switches to Vertex AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/genai/chatbot/aidentist \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <dentist_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"Recommend treatment for severe periodontitis"'

# Logs show:
# "Primary provider openai failed, attempting failover to vertexai"
# "Successfully executed chat with provider: vertexai"
```

# Key log patterns to watch:
# "Created new anonymous session - AnonID: xxx, SessionID: yyy"
# "Linked anonymous session xxx to user yyy"
# "Orchestrating prompt for agent: help, role: PATIENT, clinic: clinic_123"
# "Successfully executed chat with provider: openai"
# "Primary provider openai failed, attempting failover to vertexai"
```
